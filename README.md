# Smart University - DSA Project

## Overview
This project implements a Smart University Navigation and Scheduling System using core Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.  
It models university campus navigation and class scheduling problems with graphs, heaps, and linked lists.

## Features
- Shortest path finding between university locations using graph algorithms  
- Efficient timetable and scheduling management with heaps  
- Custom linked list implementations for managing data  
- Practical application of fundamental DSA concepts  

## Technologies
- Java  
- Core Data Structures: Graphs, Heaps, Linked Lists  
- Algorithms for shortest path and scheduling

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrghost077/Smart-University-DSA-project.git
```
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
3. Compile and run the main classes to test navigation and scheduling features
